# live-weather-forecast-using-public-api
In this Angular project, the angular application is connected to a public API. I have used the public API from rapidapi.com to get the live weather data for all the cities. Angular forms have been used to get the user input, which is the city name. An Angular service is created to call the weather API from the Angular application.
