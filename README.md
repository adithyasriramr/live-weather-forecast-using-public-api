# live-weather-forecast-using-public-api
In this Angular project, we connect our Angular application to a Public API. We connect the open weather api from Rapidapi.com to our Angular application and will get live weather data for cities. We use Angular forms to get the user input and search by city name. We then create an Angular service to call the weather API from our Angular application.
